# Flutter Development Commands

## Package Management
```bash
flutter pub get                    # Install dependencies
flutter pub upgrade               # Update packages
flutter pub outdated              # Check for outdated packages
```

## Development
```bash
flutter run -d <device_id>        # Run on simulator/device
flutter run -d chrome             # Run on web
flutter run -d android            # Run on Android device
flutter run -d ios                # Run on iOS simulator
```

## Code Quality & Analysis
```bash
flutter analyze                   # Static code analysis (fix all warnings)
dart format .                     # Format code (run before commits)
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs  # Generate *.g.dart files
```

## Testing
```bash
flutter test                      # Run all tests
flutter test --plain-name "test name"  # Run specific test
flutter test test/features/auth/  # Run tests in directory
```

## Building for Production
```bash
flutter build apk                 # Android APK
flutter build appbundle           # Android App Bundle
flutter build ios                 # iOS (requires macOS)
flutter build web                 # Web build
```

## Pre-commit Checklist
Always run these before committing:
1. `flutter analyze` (fix warnings)
2. `dart format .` (format code)
3. `flutter test` (run tests)
4. `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` (regenerate code)
